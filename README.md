# gradepointaverage
Python app to calculate GPA

This app calculates the cummulative grade point average of a student based on data entered. 
I first built this with PHP & MySQL as a class project, and then decided to recreate the app when learning Python. 
This version of the app is console-only, with no UI.

I built it without a UI becasue I intend to include in as a module in the School Management app I'm building (using Django with MySQL on Focal Fossa).
